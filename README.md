## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before diving into the setup, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

* **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Required for running the frontend development server and managing frontend dependencies (Node.js version 16 or higher is recommended). You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).
* **Python:** Necessary for running the backend application (Python 3.9 or higher is recommended). Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **pip:** The package installer for Python, usually included with Python installations.
* **FFmpeg:** A crucial command-line tool used by MoviePy for video processing. Make sure it's installed on your system and accessible through your system's PATH environment variable. You can typically install it using your operating system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS).
* **ClamAV (Optional):** If you intend to enable virus scanning (`CLAMAV_ENABLED=true` in the backend `.env`), ensure you have the ClamAV daemon (`clamd`) and the command-line scanner (`clamscan`) installed and running on your system. Installation instructions vary depending on your operating system.
* **AWS Account and S3 Bucket:** You will need an active AWS account and an S3 bucket created to store uploaded and processed video files.
* **Git:** For cloning the project repository. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal and execute the following command, replacing `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd mp4-to-gif-converter
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory in your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

    * **Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended):** This isolates the project's dependencies.

        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
        # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```

    * **Install Python Dependencies:** Install all the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    * **Configure Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory to store sensitive information like AWS credentials. You can start by copying the example file (if provided) or creating it manually.

        ```bash
        touch .env
        ```

        **Example `backend/.env` file (`backend/.env`):**

        ```env
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
        AWS_REGION=your_aws_s3_bucket_region # e.g., us-east-1
        S3_BUCKET=your_s3_bucket_name
        CLAMAV_ENABLED=true # Set to 'false' to disable ClamAV
        # FLASK_DEBUG=True # Uncomment for development debug mode
        ```

        **Important:** Ensure you replace the placeholder values with your actual AWS credentials and S3 bucket details.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate back to the project's root directory and then into the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

    * **Install JavaScript Dependencies:** Install all the required JavaScript packages using npm or yarn.

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

        **Alternatively, if you use yarn:**

        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```

    * **Configure Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory to store frontend-specific configurations.

        ```bash
        touch .env
        ```

        **Example `frontend/.env` file (`frontend/.env`):**

        ```env
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
        ```

        Ensure `REACT_APP_API_URL` points to the address where your backend server will be running.

## üöÄ Running the Application

Follow these instructions to start both the backend and frontend servers:

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `backend` directory, and activate the virtual environment if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    source venv/bin/activate # Or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    python app.py
    ```

    The backend server will typically start and be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. You should see output in the terminal indicating that the Flask development server is running.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    Open another terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    ```

    This command will usually open the frontend application in your default web browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will then communicate with the backend server running on port 5000.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Here's a more detailed explanation of the environment variables used by the application:

**Backend (`backend/.env`):**

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS IAM user's access key ID, which grants programmatic access to your AWS resources.
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS IAM user's secret access key, used in conjunction with the access key ID to authenticate your requests to AWS. **Treat this as highly sensitive information.**
* `AWS_REGION`: The specific AWS region where your S3 bucket is located (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-2`). Ensure this matches your bucket's region.
* `S3_BUCKET`: The name of the AWS S3 bucket that will be used to store uploaded and processed video files.
* `CLAMAV_ENABLED`: A boolean value (`true` or `false`) that determines whether ClamAV virus scanning will be performed on uploaded files. Set to `true` to enable and `false` to disable. Ensure ClamAV is properly installed and configured if you enable this.
* `FLASK_APP`: (Optional) Specifies the main Flask application file. It usually defaults to `app.py`.
* `FLASK_ENV`: (Optional) Sets the Flask environment. Setting it to `development` enables debug mode, which provides more detailed error messages and automatic reloading upon code changes. This is generally recommended for development but should be disabled in production.
* `PORT`: (Optional) Defines the port on which the Flask development server will listen. If not set here, it might be defined in the `app.py` file (typically defaults to 5000).

**Frontend (`frontend/.env`):**

* `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The base URL of your backend API. The frontend will make HTTP requests to this URL to interact with the backend (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`). The `REACT_APP_` prefix is necessary for Create React App to recognize these environment variables.

## üåê API Endpoints (Backend)

Here's a brief overview of the primary API endpoints exposed by the backend application (defined in `backend/app.py`):

* `POST /upload`: Accepts direct video file uploads from the frontend.
* `POST /process-url`: Handles requests to process videos based on a provided URL.
* `POST /analyze`: Analyzes the uploaded or URL-provided video to extract information like duration and scene changes, and generates a temporary preview URL.
* `POST /convert`: Takes the processed video and user-defined settings to perform the conversion to either a GIF or an MP4 file.
* `GET /`: A basic home endpoint that can be used to check if the API server is running.

*(Note: All the above endpoints also support `OPTIONS` requests. These are automatically handled by Flask-CORS to facilitate Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for web applications.)*

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Ideas)

Here are some potential ideas for future development and improvements:

* **Expanded Output Formats:** Add support for converting videos to other popular formats like WebM.
* **Advanced Text Overlay Options:** Implement more sophisticated text overlay features, such as text animations and the ability for users to upload custom fonts.
* **Image Overlay/Watermarking:** Allow users to overlay images or add watermarks to their videos and GIFs.
* **User Accounts and History:** Introduce user accounts to save conversion history and preferences.
* **Batch Processing:** Enable users to upload and process multiple videos simultaneously.
* **Enhanced Scene Detection and Smart Trimming:** Explore more advanced algorithms for scene detection and provide more intelligent trimming suggestions.
* **Dockerization:** Containerize the application using Docker for easier deployment and management across different environments.
