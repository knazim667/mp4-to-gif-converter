## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before diving into the setup, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

* **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Required for running the frontend development server and managing frontend dependencies (Node.js version 16 or higher is recommended). You can download them from nodejs.org or yarnpkg.com.
* **Python:** Necessary for running the backend application (Python 3.9 or higher is recommended). Download it from python.org.
* **pip:** The package installer for Python, usually included with Python installations.
* **FFmpeg:** A crucial command-line tool used by MoviePy for video processing. Make sure it's installed on your system and accessible through your system's PATH environment variable. You can typically install it using your operating system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS).
* **ClamAV (Optional):** If you intend to enable virus scanning (`CLAMAV_ENABLED=true` in the backend `.env`), ensure you have the ClamAV daemon (`clamd`) and the command-line scanner (`clamscan`) installed and running on your system. Installation instructions vary depending on your operating system.
* **AWS Account and S3 Bucket:** You will need an active AWS account and an S3 bucket created to store uploaded and processed video files.
* **Email Account for Sending (e.g., Gmail with App Password):** If setting up the contact form, you'll need an email account configured for SMTP sending.
* **Git:** For cloning the project repository. Download it from git-scm.com.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal and execute the following command, replacing `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd mp4-to-gif-converter
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory in your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

    * **Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended):** This isolates the project's dependencies.

        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
        # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```

    * **Install Python Dependencies:** Install all the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    * **Configure Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.

        ```bash
        touch .env
        ```

        **Example `backend/.env` file:**

        ```env
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
        AWS_REGION=your_aws_s3_bucket_region # e.g., us-east-1
        S3_BUCKET=your_s3_bucket_name
        CLAMAV_ENABLED=true # Set to 'false' to disable ClamAV
        FLASK_DEBUG=True # Set to 'False' for production

        # Email Configuration for Flask-Mail (e.g., for Gmail)
        MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
        MAIL_PORT=587
        MAIL_USE_TLS=True
        MAIL_USE_SSL=False
        MAIL_USERNAME=your.gmail.address@gmail.com
        MAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password # Use an App Password if 2FA is enabled
        MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER='EasyGIFMaker Contact <your.gmail.address@gmail.com>'
        CONTACT_FORM_RECIPIENT=your_receiving_email@example.com # Where contact messages will be sent
        ```

        **Important:** Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and details.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate back to the project's root directory and then into the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

    * **Install JavaScript Dependencies:**

        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        # yarn install
        ```

    * **Configure Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory.

        ```bash
        touch .env
        ```

        **Example `frontend/.env` file:**

        ```env
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
        ```

        Ensure `REACT_APP_API_URL` points to your backend server.

## üöÄ Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open a terminal, navigate to `backend/`, activate the virtual environment, and run:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    Open another terminal, navigate to `frontend/`, and run:

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    ```
    The frontend will typically open at `http://localhost:3000`.
